# Crypto_currency-Predictive-Model
# To find the percentage increase/decrease for the next 5 mins of Bitcoins.
Cryptocurrency had been on the raise in recent years and increments had been obvious in recent months and prices had been very volatile, the purpose of this machines learning is to predict percentage increase/decrease in the next 5mins of bitcoins. The study of this project is solely for academic purpose as prices may be affected by varies other sources example will be news of new partnership or closure of certain core purpose of the crypto. Hence please understand the risk and do your own study when making any investements. 

# The project will be broken into 3 sections.
## Part A: Reading and cleaning the data.
We will select the libarary yfinance which takes the live data from yahoo finance. We will be selecting 18 coins including bitcoins for the study.
## Part B: Analysis of the data.
We will do a analysis on the merge data, finding the correlationship between the tokens.For question 2 we will import yfinance bitcoins.

Sub Questions: 

1) When are the correlationship between the coins.
2) When is the best time to purchase bitcoins

## Part C: Machine learning with varies models and select the best for tuning.
We will be using regression model for this study as we will be predicting the furture price increment or decrease percentage of bitcoins. We will be using 2 models and 2 ensemble methods namely:

1) Linear Regression\
2) SVR\
3) XGBoost\
4) Random Forest\
And select the model with the best result to do fine tuning.

***Please note that we will be using real life data hence with every reset best fit model may differs***
